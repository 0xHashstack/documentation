# Creating Proposals on Github

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an issue on GitHub. By following these steps, you can effectively propose an integration of another DeFi protocol on the Hashstack's Layer 3.

#### **Step 1: Access the Hashstack Layer 3 Integration** [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/0xHashstack/V1-L3)

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Hashstack Layer 3 Integration GitHub repository.
2. Ensure that you are logged into your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, create one by following the instructions on GitHub's website.

#### **Step 2: Navigate to the "Issues" Section**

1. On the repository page, locate the navigation menu at the top of the page.
2. Click on the "Issues" tab, which will take you to the issues section of the repository.

#### **Step 3: Create a New Issue**

1. On the issues page, locate the "New Issue" button and click on it.
2. You will be presented with a form to create a new issue.

#### **Step 4: Provide Relevant Details**

1. In the title field, enter a concise and descriptive title for your integration proposal. For example, "Proposal: Integration of \[Protocol Name] with Hashstack Layer 3."
2. In the description field, provide a clear and detailed explanation of the integration proposal.
3. Start by introducing the protocol you are proposing to integrate and provide a brief overview of its features and benefits.
4. Explain how the integration with Hashstack Layer 3 can enhance both protocols and the broader DeFi ecosystem.
5. Outline the technical requirements, such as smart contract compatibility, data structure alignment, or API integration.
6. Discuss any potential challenges or considerations that need to be addressed during the integration process.
7. Provide any relevant links or resources that support your proposal, such as the protocol's documentation or GitHub repository.

#### **Step 5: Add Labels and Assignees (if applicable)**

1. Labels help categorize and organize issues. If there are predefined labels available, choose the most appropriate one(s) for your integration proposal.
2. If there are specific team members or contributors you want to assign to the issue, you can use the "Assignees" field to assign them. However, this step is optional.

#### **Step 6: Preview and Submit**

1. Before submitting your issue, use the preview tab to review your description and ensure all the necessary details are included.
2. Once you are satisfied with the content, click the "Submit new issue" button to create the issue.

#### **Step 7: Engage in Discussion**

1. After submitting the issue, other contributors, team members, or community members may engage in the discussion.
2. Stay engaged in the conversation by responding to comments, providing clarifications, or addressing any questions or concerns raised.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an issue on GitHub proposing the integration of another DeFi protocol with the Hashstack Layer 3 Integration project. This enables you to actively participate in the development process, foster collaboration, and contribute to the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. Remember to check back periodically for updates and respond to any additional inquiries related to your issue.&#x20;

Your proposal helps drive innovation and the seamless integration of protocols within Hashstack!
