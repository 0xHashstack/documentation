# Hashstack Layer 3 Integration

## **Introduction**

The Hashstack Layer 3 Integration team aims to actively facilitate the integration of other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with Hashstack. Our primary goal is to foster collaboration and create a seamless integration experience that benefits the broader DeFi ecosystem. This document provides an overview of our objectives and the processes involved in achieving successful protocol integrations.



### Objective

The main objective of Hashstack Layer 3 Integration Community Development is to enable the smooth integration of various DeFi protocols with Hashstack. This integration can be accomplished in two ways:&#x20;

1. Proactive Integration: We actively seek out potential integration opportunities with other DeFi protocols. By identifying compatible projects, we can initiate discussions and collaborations to facilitate the integration process.
2. Proposal and Issue Resolution: We provide a platform for other protocols to propose and address any issues related to integrating their protocol with Hashstack. This ensures that all concerns and requirements are effectively communicated and resolved in a timely manner.

####

### Benefits

By fostering integration with Hashstack, both Hashstack and the participating protocols can benefit from the following:

1. Enhanced Functionality: Integration with Hashstack Layer 3 allows protocols to leverage their capabilities and expand their offerings. This enhances the overall functionality and user experience of the integrated protocols.
2. Expanded User Base: Through integration, protocols gain access to Hashstack's user base, which can significantly increase their reach and adoption. This opens up new opportunities for growth and exposure within the DeFi community.
3. Collaborative Ecosystem: Integration promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing among protocols, fostering a vibrant and interconnected DeFi ecosystem. By working together, we can collectively advance the industry and drive innovation.

### **Integration Process**

The integration process involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The Integration team evaluates potential integration opportunities based on compatibility, strategic alignment, and technical feasibility. This assessment helps identify suitable protocols for integration.
2. **Collaboration and Proposal**: Once a potential integration opportunity is identified, the team collaborates with the protocol's development team to discuss the integration scope, requirements, and potential benefits. The protocol's team submits a proposal outlining the integration plan.
3. **Technical Integration**: Upon agreement, the technical integration process begins. This involves aligning the protocols' smart contract architectures, data structures, and API compatibility. Developers from both sides work closely to ensure a seamless integration that adheres to best practices and security standards.
4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures are conducted to ensure the integrated protocols function as intended. This includes comprehensive unit testing, integration testing, and stress testing to identify and address any potential issues or vulnerabilities.
5. **Deployment and Rollout**: Once the integration passes all testing and quality assurance stages, it is deployed to a test network or staging environment for final verification. After successful verification, the integration is rolled out to the main network, making it available to users.
6. **Ongoing Support and Maintenance**: Post-integration, the Hashstack Layer 3 Integration team provides ongoing support and maintenance to address any issues or improvements that arise. Regular communication and collaboration between the integrated protocols continue to foster successful integration.
7. **Code Contribution**: If you are a developer looking to contribute to the integration process, create an issue on the project's GitHub repository. In the issue, propose your approach and plan of action for the integration. This helps initiate a discussion and ensures transparency in the development process.
8. **Protocols Requesting Integration**: If you represent a protocol and wish to integrate with Hashstack, create an issue on the Hashstack GitHub repository, outlining your integration request and providing the necessary details. This initiates the discussion and collaboration process with the Integration team.

### Additional Information for developers

* **Understanding Development Dependencies:** It's important to note that the Hashstack Layer 3 repository has dependencies on Hashstack V1-Core, which is currently a private repository at the time of this writing. To contribute code, developers are requested to reach out to the Hashstack team either by mentioning it in the GitHub issue or through the official Discord channel.
* **Access to V1-Core Repository**: Once you have expressed your interest in contributing code, the Hashstack team will provide access to the V1-Core repository. This access allows you to understand and work with the necessary dependencies required for the integration.
* **Understanding the Project Structure**:
  1. Before creating an issue, it's recommended to have a good understanding of the overall structure and architecture of the Hashstack Layer 3 Integration project.
  2. Start by reading the README file on the repository's main page. The README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and the key components involved.
  3. Familiarize yourself with the project's documentation, including any developer guides or technical specifications available.
  4. All the test cases are written with Protostar and are in V1-Core.

####

### **Conclusion**

Hashstack Layer 3 Integration team is committed to facilitating seamless integration between Hashstack and other DeFi protocols. By leveraging collaboration and providing a platform for proposal and issue resolution, we aim to create an interconnected DeFi ecosystem that benefits all participants. We encourage protocol developers to explore integration opportunities with Hashstack and work together to push the boundaries of decentralized finance.
