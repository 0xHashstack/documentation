# Introduction

Hashstack allows users to take under-collateralized loans. The loans can be spent on various dapps like AMMs, Vaults, DEXs allowing you to increase your capital efficiency. The project broadly contains the following stakeholders:

1. Suppliers
2. Borrowers
3. Liquidators

We first discuss about how the deposits and borrows are handled in the system. The system has a provision to spend the loan on pre-configured integrations, which we call as Layer-3 (L3) Integrations. The loans given to users stay within the Open protocol and users have the right to spend these loans on supported integrations via Open.&#x20;

The profit or loss made through spending on these integrations is on the user and Open shall recover the loan anytime by liquidating the collateral if the loan falls below a certain threshold. Any user is allowed a maximum debt of 5x the collateral. This is to ensure proper risk management and protection of user deposits/supplies.
