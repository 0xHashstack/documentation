Hashstack provides a permissionless zk-native money market protocol enabling secure under-collateralised loans to the crypto retail. Built on [Starknet L2](https://starkware.com) \[[announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-08-08/announcing-hashstack-s-switch-to-starknet)], Hashstack leverages the capability of zero-knowledge proofs to provide a cost & capital-efficient lending solution.

Hashstack scales upon the foundations of incumbent money markets ([Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Euler Finance](https://www.euler.finance/)) by addressing the blindspots & grey areas for better-balanced risks, and value-add for the system participants, with composability at its core.

**A basic summary of Hashstack's Open is as follows:**

Developed on the protocol of the same name, through Open, anyone anywhere worldwide can borrow up to three times their collateral, completely permission-less, without the need for trusted 3rd parties. That is, one can borrow up to US$300 with collateral of as little as US$100. This is 328% more loan against the collateral when compared to the incumbent money markets â€” [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/en/).



The $300 loan can be spent in two ways.

1. Use the loan in its entirety as trading capital.
2. Withdraw a portion\[ up to $70, i.e. up to 70% collateral equivalent] into the borrowerâ€™s personal wallet, with the balance of $230 staying within the protocol to be used as trading capital.

The ownership of the balance loan remains with the Open, with the borrower having the right to spend. Open integrates dapps of critical novelty across zk L2 & L1s, where the loan can be spent. For, eg, A borrower can trade the $300 loan for equivalent BTC on DyDx on Starknet. Here, the transfer of assets happens on a protocol level between Open & DyDx, while the state change of the loan market is recorded for the borrower. If the trade returns a positive yield, the borrower makes a profit, which is for his to keep. The borrower can repay the debt and exit the transaction with positive returns.
