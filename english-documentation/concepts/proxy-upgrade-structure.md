# ðŸ’» Proxy/Upgrade Structure

* Hashstack requires a strong upgrade structure to handle integrations and new functionalities while maintaining previous user balances without migration.
* The Open protocol is designed using the Modular Smart Contract standard, which closely mirrors the Diamond standard.
* The Open protocol Diamond contains the core Open functionality, while the L3-Integrations Diamond contains all the integration functionalities.
* The two Diamonds allow for independent addition of integrations or new functionalities in a modular and seamless fashion.
