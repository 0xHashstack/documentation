# ðŸŽ® Slippage Control

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected or requested price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. It is commonly observed in markets with high volatility, low liquidity or token pairs in low demand.

It's important to note that during the initial phase with low TVL (Total Value Locked), higher slippage cases are more likely to occur. Blocking a trade due to slippage can result in a dissatisfied user experience. As a trade-off, larger slippage is authorized until the TVL of the asset grows to a healthy liquidity level.
