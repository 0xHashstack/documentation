# ✍️ Content Creators Program (CCP)

We are introducing the "Content Creators Program", a campaign in which anyone can showcase their creativity by generating content about Hashstack and earn points!

#### **The Content Creators Program (CCP)**

* A campaign in which creators generate content about Hashstack, covering use cases, benefits, how others can get involved, etc.
* This content may take the form of articles, threads, videos, memes, posts, documentation, etc.
* These pieces aim to encourage readers to learn more about Hashstack.
* Creators can **use any language** to create! In fact content in any language other than English automatically gets twice the points. More on the points system below.
