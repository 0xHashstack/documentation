# Repay borrow

Repay borrow typically involves repaying the loan by providing additional collateral. Any unused collateral that has not been utilized for repaying the loan will be available to the borrower on the platform.



You can repay the loan anytime you want to:

* Go to "your borrow" page. From the borrow actions, click on "Repay borrow" option.
