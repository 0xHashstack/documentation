# Withdraw Supply

**Note: If you have your tokens staked, but want to withdraw those tokens from the protocol, then you need to** [**unstake them first**](https://docs.hashstack.finance/hub/101-guides/unstaking-rtokens)**.** This is how staked tokens look like (5 rDAI staked in the picture).

Here are the steps to withdraw supply:

1. Go to "your supply" tab and choose which supply ID you want to withdraw from and click on "Actions".
