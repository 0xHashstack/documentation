# ðŸ’° Contribute-2-Earn

C2E stands for 'Contribute to Earn,' which means that our community members can earn by actively working with us on our project. We're going forward with it and experimenting on how we can incentivise our community members for their contribution.

We have set up a few tasks in zealy through which we are manually checking our community members efforts! Access it here: [https://zealy.io/c/hashstack](https://zealy.io/c/hashstack)

Once you start contributing, you will receive a "C2E" role which denotes about your active participation by engaging with the Hashstack community and helping it grow to its full potential.
