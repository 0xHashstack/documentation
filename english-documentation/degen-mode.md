# üìà Degen Mode

## Introduction

Degen Mode is a powerful feature that simplifies the leveraged arbitrage in the cryptocurrency market. With Degen Mode, you can easily explore market opportunities, enabling you to swiftly identify and act upon them with optimal strategies. This gives users a competitive edge.

Degen Mode allows users to provide liquidity and engage in swaps within integrated dapps, facilitating the accumulation of higher APR. This feature lets users act quickly on opportunities and execute strategies efficiently, making it easier for them to stay ahead in the market.

## Selecting the Strategy

This feature is accessible to users with a supply of $1,000 or more in a single asset. If your supply falls below this threshold, you'll receive a friendly reminder to ensure your address has sufficient supply. The strategy involves borrowing and spending a fixed amount of $5000 worth of assets. Users with multiple collaterals higher than $1000 will be able to switch between the collaterals and extend their supply. Since there is a fixed amount a user can borrow and spend, if the user supplies more than $1000 then it will not increase the borrowed amount, instead, it helps user to reduce their leverage position.

Let‚Äôs understand this through an example. We will use ETH as a base, $1000 worth of single assets, and $5000 worth of assets as a fixed borrow.

Example 1:

Alice supplied $1000 worth of ETH. Alice selects the ETH strategy from the degen screen and executes it. Alice went through the standard procedure where she supplied $1000 worth of ETH and spent $5000 and has leverage of 5x.



Example 2:

Bob supplied $2500 worth of ETH. Bob selects the ETH strategy and executes it. Bob reduced his leverage position to 2.5x.



Example 3: Charlie supplied 2 different assets with each $1000 worth of ETH and BTC. Charlie can now select the best strategy based on the holdings of ETH, and BTC.

Various strategies for Liquidity Provisions and Swaps will be displayed based on the optimal strategy, max APR, and market depth from which users can make the informed decision and execute them.

The advantages of Degen Mode lie in its ability to assist users in minimizing risks to the greatest extent possible while enabling swift action for potentially higher returns. Nevertheless, it's important to note that this approach doesn't guarantee a risk-free return.
