In the airdrop leaderboard page, you can see:

2. The blue box content has the duration, epoch and snapshot details of the campaign.

The leaderboard has the information on:

* wallet address which are truncated
* liquidity generated (both by them and their referrals)
* points obtained
* estimated $HASH a user would earn with those points.



There are **two point systems**: near real-time and snapshot-based.

* Near real-time: These points are updated in near real time (\~12 hours) whenever you perform transactions on the Mainnet V1 dApp.
* Snapshot-based: These points are the average of all your points across the snapshots taken at each epoch. **They will be considered for the airdrop.**
