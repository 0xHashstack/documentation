# General FAQs

**Q. Which chains/networks does Hashstack support?**

Hashstack supports only Starknet at the moment. More major L1's/L2's will be announced later on.



Q. **How does Hashstack get its price feeds?**

Hashstack uses Pragma Network to get both price and computational feeds. The price feeds are used as a reference price for the users. Computational feeds, on the other hand, are used to calculate the volatility of the assets, which in turn drives the calculation of permissible CDR \[**C**ollateral to **D**ebt **R**atio].
