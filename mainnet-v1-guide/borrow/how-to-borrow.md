# How to borrow

Hashstack allows you to borrow up to 3 times the value of the collateral provided.

Let’s take a look at how we can borrow from the protocol:

1. On the Dashboard screen, you will see a “Borrow\*”\* button next to the assets of Hashstack’s primary markets. Click on the button.

2. Once the pop-up box appears, then you can borrow the asset by providing collateral. After choosing the MCP, click on “Borrow” button.

The Borrowing APR (i.e., the interest you need to pay annually) will be visible at the bottom of the popup.

_Borrowing has 2 commitment periods:_

* _None - for flexible MCP_
* _1 month_
{% endhint %}



3. Choose the token for the collateral, the collateral amount, MCP and borrow amount. Then press on the “borrow” button.
